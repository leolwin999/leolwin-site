## Intro

Imagine you are in Shanghai.

You're hungry, you decide to try dumplings. You can't speak Chinese, so you bring a translator guy along.
  
You tell him, "I want dumplings," and he translates the order  into  Chinese for the store owner. The store owner wraps some dumplings up, and hands them over. Piece of cake, right?  
  
In this scenario:  
- You are the programmer.
- The translator is the some high-level programming language.
- The shop owner is the kernel.
- And dumplings are the tasks you want the computer to do.
  
Now here's the kicker. What if you want something other than just dumplings?  
  
What if you'd  prefer to haggle the price, compliment the taste, or ask the owner how her day's been? Now, the translator can make mistakes. He might misinterpret your tone, skip details, or not translate the nuance correctly.
  
So what's the solution?
  
Learn Chinese and speak for yourself **directly**!
  
That's exactly what assembly language lets you do. It gives you low-level access to the CPU, letting you fine-tune performance and understand how your instructions run under the hood. 
  
If you’re curious about how computers really work or if you simply enjoy getting some hands-on with bare-metal programming, then these assembly projects are a great place to start.  
  
I'll be posting projects here, sorted from beginner-friendly to more advanced ones. Feel free to explore whatever  you find  interesting.

Happy  coding!

## Simple Hello
A very simple hello program, just like starting out in any programming language. This is your first step into the world of low-level programming. No compilers or fancy libraries but raw instructions, system calls, and a direct conversation with the machine.  
Skills you'll gain:
-   Basic x86_64 intel syntax structure (`section .data`, `section .text`, etc.)
-   Writing text to the terminal using `syscall`
-   Understanding registers like `rax`, `rdi`, `rsi`, and `rdx`
-   Intro to Linux system calls (like `write`)
-   How memory and code segments are organized in an assembly program

## Below Or Above
A simple program that checks if a number entered by the user is below, above, or within a specific range. It's like a mini decision-maker that shows how logic flows in low-level programming.  
Skills you'll gain:
-   Conditional logic in assembly (cmp, jl, jg, je, jmp, etc.)
-   User input handling
-   Number comparison using registers
-   Using system calls for I/O
-   Control flow using jumps

> Fetch the code [here!](https://github.com/leolwin999/Assembly-Projects/blob/main/Assembly_Files/below_or_above.asm)

## Addition
A beginner-friendly project that takes two numbers, adds them together, and shows the result. This helps you understand how math works at the register level.  
Skills you'll gain:
-   Register manipulation
-   Arithmetic operations (add, mov)
-   Handling user input for numbers
-   Converting ascii strings to integers and vice versa
-   Printing results to stdout

> Fetch the code [here!](https://github.com/leolwin999/Assembly-Projects/blob/main/Assembly_Files/addition.asm)

## Input Output
Reads a user’s input from the terminal and echoes it back. It’s the foundation of interacting with users in CLI-based assembly programs.  
Skills you'll gain:
-   Reading input from stdin
-   Writing output to stdout
-   Using `syscall` for I/O
-   Working with memory buffers
-   String handling basics

> Fetch the code [here!](https://github.com/leolwin999/Assembly-Projects/blob/main/Assembly_Files/input_output.asm)

## Read File
This program reads content from a `.txt` file and prints it to the terminal. It shows how to interact with files on your system through system calls.  
Skills you'll gain:
-   File handling using system calls (`open`, `read`, `close`)
-   Using file descriptors
-   Buffer management
-   Error checking in system-level code
-   Working with real-world file paths

> Fetch the code [here!](https://github.com/leolwin999/Assembly-Projects/blob/main/Assembly_Files/read_file.asm)

## Write File
This program writes contents to a `.txt` file. It overwrite the file or create one if not existed. It also shows how to interact with files on your system through system calls.  
Skills you'll gain:
-   File handling using system calls (`write`,`open`,`close`)
-   Using different syscall flags
-   Create and overwriting the file
-   Error checking in system-level code
-   Bitwise calculating 

> Fetch the code [here!](https://github.com/leolwin999/Assembly-Projects/blob/main/Assembly_Files/write_file.asm)

## Reverse String
Enter a string and watch it reversed like magic. This teaches how to navigate and manipulate memory, one byte at a time.  
Skills you'll gain:
-   Working with string pointers
-   Looping through memory
-   Manual character swapping
-   Memory addressing and indexing
-   Buffer usage and length calculation

> Fetch the code [here!](https://github.com/leolwin999/Assembly-Projects/blob/main/Assembly_Files/reverse_string.asm)

## Random
Generates a random number between 0 and 100. A fun way to explore randomness without high-level libraries. Only with raw CPU and system calls.  
Skills you'll gain:
-   Using `rdrand` instruction (if supported)
-   Bitmasking and modulo for range limiting
-   File reading for randomness
-   Converting random bytes to integers
-   Simple math operations in registers

> Fetch the code [here!](https://github.com/leolwin999/Assembly-Projects/blob/main/Assembly_Files/random.asm)

## Server
A basic TCP server that listens on a port and handles simple incoming connections. Writing a server in assembly is easier than you think!  
Skills you'll gain:
-   Socket creation with `sys_socket`
-   Binding and listening on a port
-   Accepting client connections
-   Networking syscalls (bind, listen, accept)
-   Low-level networking logic and buffer handling

> Fetch the code [here!](https://github.com/leolwin999/Assembly-Projects/blob/main/Assembly_Files/server.asm)

## Client
A TCP client that connects to a server and sends a message. Complements the server project and completes the full communication loop. (Super easy!)  
Skills you'll gain:
-   Creating and connecting a socket
-   Sending and receiving messages
-   IP/Port formatting (structs in memory)
-   Network protocol basics (TCP)
-   Error handling in system-level code

> Fetch the code [here!](https://github.com/leolwin999/Assembly-Projects/blob/main/Assembly_Files/client.asm)

## Web Scraper
A low-level web scraper built without high-level languages or libraries, just pure assembly and system calls. It connects to a website, sends an HTTP request, and reads the response directly from the socket. It’s a deeper dive into networking, protocols, and memory handling.  
Skills you'll gain:
-   Working with TCP sockets in assembly (socket, connect, send, recv)
-   Using stack and struct
-   Crafting raw HTTP requests (GET method, headers, etc.)
-   Managing buffers and dynamic content
-   Understanding network protocols (IP, TCP, HTTP) at a low level
