Hello Again! 👋  
I started this blog to share my experiences and knowledge, also as a way to track my own learnings and force myself to breakdown the complex topics.  
    
Being a techie while working as a seafarer isn’t as easy as it sounds, especially in the middle of the sea.  
  
Imagine spending your day in a noisy engine room, sweating in 40°C heat, running on 4 hours of sleep, with barely any internet (if you’re lucky), and constantly juggling physical and mental stress, duties, routines, and drills of who knows what.  
  
But hey I do this to support my parents, pay the bills, and take care of the people I love, especially my big mama (my grandma 👵🏼) .  
  
Anyway, I didn’t write this to be a sob story. The real reason for this blog is to share what I’ve been learning on my tech journey.  
  
And I’m not professional, just a skid.
  
Thanks for stopping by. Hope you find something helpful while you're here. 🤗

## Education

I finished high school in 2020, but due to political issues in my country and financial challenges in my family, I couldn’t continue to university.  
Still, I’m learning everything I can on my own and might pursue college later when the time (and world) is right. 🎓
