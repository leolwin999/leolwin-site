Hello Again! 👋  
I started this blog to share my experiences and knowledge, also as a way to track my own learning and force myself to breakdown the complex topics.
  
Being a techie while working as a seafarer isn’t as easy as it sounds — especially in the middle of the sea.  
  
Imagine spending your day in a noisy engine room, sweating in 40°C heat, running on 4 hours of sleep, with barely any internet (if you’re lucky), and constantly juggling physical and mental stress, duties, routines, and drills of who knows what.
  
The hardest part is watching your high school classmates and people of your age graduate while you’re lying in your cabin with back pain and muscle cramps, knowing you have a 4 a.m. duty coming up.
  
But hey — I do this to support my parents, to pay the bills, and to take care of the people I love, especially my big mama (my grandma 👵🏼) .  
  
Anyway, I didn’t write this to be a sob story. The real reason for this blog is to share what I’ve been learning on my tech journey.  
I’m not some elite hacker — just someone trying to grow, one step at a time.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something helpful while you're here. 🤗

## Education

I finished high school in 2020, but due to political issues in my country and financial challenges in my family, I couldn’t continue to university.  
Still, I haven’t given up — I’m learning everything I can on my own and might pursue college later when the time (and world) is right. 🎓💪
